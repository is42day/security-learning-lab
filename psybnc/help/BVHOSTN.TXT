BVHOST ident :network-prefix vhost
----------------------------------
sets the VHOST of an ident at a secondary network.
You can also set the bouncer to use your virtual hosts if 
present on the server from which the bouncer is running. 
Example: 
/BVHOSTN TestUser :E This.Is.Only.Virtual.Com
would change the vhost of TestUser on the network E to
This.Is.Only.Virtual.Com.
