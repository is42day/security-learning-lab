BRAW ident :command
-------------------
Used to simulate a command to a given ident. It has to be
very format strict or it might not work as intended.
Example:
/BRAW TestUser :PRIVMSG #MyChannel :Testing testing
Would send the message "Testing testing" to the channel #MyChannel
as the user with the ident TestUser. Note the two colons.
