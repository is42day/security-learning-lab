SETCONNECTDELAY [duration in seconds]
-------------------------------------------
Changes the delay psyBNC (re)connects users to their IRC-servers.
Duration must be an integer value between 0 (zero) and 600 seconds.
This affects all users and are available for bounceadmins only.
If set to zero, NO users will (re)connect at all.
Each 10th minute, a log will be put in the psybnc.log if SETCONNECTDELAY is 0.
